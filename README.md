### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**shyamalschandra/shyamalschandra** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Swift 6.0+ and Python 3.13+ projects with bash shell scripts.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning different design patterns for advanced and mastering Swift 5.8+.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an open-source project involving Swift and Python with bash/zsh script.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my issues that have not been resolved and glad to meet Swift and Python programmers.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything CS, algorithms, and data structures-related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sschandr@icloud.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I finished 1st (out of 10K) in a MSFT Stock Challenge when I was in grade school AFAIR (as far as I remember).
